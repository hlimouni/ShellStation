In order to enable syntax highlighting run the following command in your terminal:
`export SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHTING=ON`

the same thing for Auto Suggestions:
`export AUTO_SUGGESTIONS=ON`

you can also turn them off, by changing their values with `OFF`.

To know available `Hotkeys` check `srcs/readline/process_input.c`, I don't have time to list them here.
